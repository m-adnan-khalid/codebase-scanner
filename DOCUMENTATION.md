## 1. What Is This?

Claude Code Scanner is a tool that scans your existing codebase and generates a complete Claude Code development environment tailored to your project. Instead of manually configuring agents, skills, and rules, the scanner reads your actual code and creates everything automatically.

**What you get:**
- 12 AI agents organized as a development team (tech lead, architect, QA lead, developers, etc.)
- 13 slash commands for common workflows
- 12 automation hooks that run behind the scenes
- A 13-phase SDLC workflow from task intake to production deployment
- Execution analytics with success scoring and hallucination detection
- Automatic drift detection that keeps your environment in sync with your codebase

**Who it's for:**
- Development teams using Claude Code who want structured AI-assisted workflows
- Projects that need role-based agent access control (read-only reviewers, write-capable developers)
- Teams that want full SDLC automation (not just code generation)

---

## 2. Quick Start

## 4. How It Works

The setup runs in 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Scan (`/scan-codebase`)

Spawns 6 parallel agents that read your actual code:

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| Technology Fingerprinter | Reads 100+ marker files (package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.) to identify languages, frameworks, databases, APIs, testing tools, and infrastructure |
| Directory Scanner | Maps your project tree up to 4 levels, classifying each directory (source, tests, config, generated, vendor) |
| Backend Scanner | Reads source files to identify API routes, middleware, validation, auth, database layer, background jobs, error handling |
| Frontend Scanner | Reads 3-5 components to identify framework, rendering mode, routing, state management, styling, TypeScript config |
| Architecture Mapper | Traces a request end-to-end through your system, maps module boundaries, dependency graph, deployment topology |
| Convention Extractor | Reads 20+ files to extract naming conventions, code style, error patterns, git conventions, TODOs, existing AI config |

**Output:** `.claude/scan-results.md` — a structured manifest of everything found.

### Phase 2: Generate (`/generate-environment`)

Takes the scan results and generates project-specific files:
- CLAUDE.md with your exact commands, paths, and conventions
- Rules that enforce your codebase patterns
- Agents configured for your tech stack
- Skills with your project's commands and file paths
- Templates extracted from your real code (not generic boilerplate)
- Hooks customized for your formatter, linter, and test runner

### Phase 3: Validate (`/validate-setup`)

Runs 170+ automated checks:
- CLAUDE.md under 200 lines, no placeholders
- All 12 agents compliant (frontmatter, HANDOFF, limitations)
- All skills have proper frontmatter (context:fork, argument-hint)
- Settings.json valid, all hooks registered
- Context budget under limits
- Flow engine documentation complete

### Phase 4: Extend (`/setup-smithery`)

Optionally installs community skills and MCP servers matching your tech stack (React tools, database connections, CI/CD integrations).

---

## 5. The Agent Team

### Understanding Agent Roles

The scanner creates a 12-agent team organized like a real development organization. Each agent has:

- **Specific tools** — what it can read/write/execute
- **Permission mode** — read-only agents can't modify code
- **Model assignment** — opus for complex reasoning, sonnet for routine work
- **Memory** — persists context across sessions
- **Structured output** — standardized HANDOFF blocks for agent-to-agent communication
- **Explicit limitations** — what the agent must NOT do

### SDLC Role Agents (Leadership)

These 4 agents manage the development process. Three are **read-only** — they review, plan, and decide, but never write code. The @team-lead has Read/Write access to orchestrate work.

#### @team-lead (Tech Lead)
```
Model: opus | Access: Read/Write | MaxTurns: 50
```
The orchestrator. Assigns tasks to agents, tracks progress, resolves blockers, provides tech sign-off. The only agent that coordinates work across the entire team.

**When to use:** You don't call @team-lead directly — the `/workflow` skill invokes it automatically. But you can ask it to check task status or resolve a blocker.

**Example:**
```
@team-lead what's the status of TASK-001?
@team-lead assign the auth refactor to @api-builder
```

#### @architect (Software Architect)
```
Model: opus | Access: Read-only | MaxTurns: 25
```
Designs solutions with alternatives and trade-offs. Reviews architecture impact of changes. Creates Mermaid diagrams.

**When to use:** Before making structural changes, when evaluating multiple approaches, or when you need a design document.

**Example:**
```
@architect design the migration from REST to GraphQL
@architect review the impact of splitting the user service
```

**Output includes:** Design options table, recommendation with rationale, Mermaid diagram, decision record.

#### @product-owner (Product Owner)
```
Model: opus | Access: Read-only | MaxTurns: 20
```
Writes acceptance criteria in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format. Validates business requirements against implementation. Provides business sign-off.

**When to use:** When defining what a feature should do, when verifying requirements are met, or during business sign-off.

**Example:**
```
@product-owner write acceptance criteria for the password reset feature
@product-owner verify TASK-001 meets the business requirements
```

**Output includes:** Acceptance criteria table (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN with PENDING/VERIFIED/FAILED status), sign-off decision.

#### @qa-lead (QA Lead)
```
Model: sonnet | Access: Read-only | MaxTurns: 25
```
Creates QA test plans, triages bugs by severity (P0-P4), provides QA sign-off. Distinct from @tester — @qa-lead plans strategy, @tester writes and runs tests.

**When to use:** When you need a test plan, when triaging bugs, or during QA sign-off.

**Example:**
```
@qa-lead create a QA plan for the checkout flow changes
@qa-lead triage these 5 bugs and recommend which block release
```

**Output includes:** Scenario table (happy path, edge cases, regression, security, accessibility), bug severity classification, sign-off decision.

### Core Agents (Specialists)

#### @explorer (Codebase Navigator)
```
Model: sonnet | Access: Read-only | MaxTurns: 30
```
Investigates how code works. Traces data flow, maps dependencies, assesses change impact.

**When to use:** When you need to understand unfamiliar code, trace a bug's path, or assess what a change will affect.

**Example:**
```
@explorer how does the auth middleware work?
@explorer what would be affected if I change the User model?
@explorer trace the order creation flow from API to database
```

**Output includes:** File:line references, dependency graph, impact assessment with risk level.

#### @reviewer (Code Reviewer)
```
Model: sonnet | Access: Read-only | MaxTurns: 20
```
Reviews code changes for quality, conventions, and correctness. Generates comments with file:line references.

**When to use:** After writing code, before creating a PR, or when reviewing someone else's changes.

**Example:**
```
@reviewer review my changes in the last 3 commits
@reviewer check the auth module for best practices
```

**Output includes:** Review summary (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES), comments table with file:line and severity.

#### @security (Security Reviewer)
```
Model: opus | Access: Read-only | MaxTurns: 20
```
Reviews code for vulnerabilities, auth issues, and OWASP Top 10 risks. Checks for injection, XSS, broken auth, PII exposure, hardcoded secrets.

**When to use:** Before any code touches auth, user input, database queries, or handles sensitive data.

**Example:**
```
@security audit the new payment endpoint
@security check for PII exposure in the logging module
```

**Output includes:** Findings table with severity/category/recommendation, risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL).

#### @debugger (Bug Fixer)
```
Model: opus | Access: Read/Write | MaxTurns: 40
```
Finds root causes and applies minimal fixes. Uses structured reasoning: reproduce, hypothesize, narrow, verify, fix, regress.

**When to use:** When tests fail, CI breaks, or there's a bug in production.

**Example:**
```
@debugger the user creation test is failing with "null reference"
@debugger fix the CI failure in the auth pipeline
```

**Output includes:** Debug report (error, root cause, evidence, fix), regression test, files modified.

#### @tester (Test Writer)
```
Model: sonnet | Access: Read/Write | MaxTurns: 30
```
Writes automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) following your project's existing patterns. Runs test suites and measures coverage.

**When to use:** After implementing a feature, when coverage is low, or when you need regression tests.

**Example:**
```
@tester write tests for the new order service
@tester check coverage for the auth module
```

**Output includes:** Test report (tests written, passing/failing, coverage before/after).

### Dev Agents (Builders)

#### @api-builder (Backend Developer)
```
Model: sonnet | Access: Read/Write + Worktree | MaxTurns: 30
```
Builds API endpoints, services, middleware, validation. Follows your project's existing patterns exactly.

**When to use:** When building backend features — routes, handlers, services, database operations.

**Example:**
```
@api-builder create POST /api/orders endpoint with validation
@api-builder add pagination to the users list endpoint
```

**Output includes:** Implementation summary (endpoint, files, auth, validation, response format).

#### @frontend (Frontend Developer)
```
Model: sonnet | Access: Read/Write + Worktree | MaxTurns: 30
```
Builds UI components, pages, styling. Ensures accessibility (ARIA, keyboard, screen reader support).

**When to use:** When building UI — components, pages, forms, styling.

**Example:**
```
@frontend create a UserProfile component with edit mode
@frontend add a dashboard page with charts
```

**Output includes:** Implementation summary (files, component API, accessibility notes).

#### @infra (DevOps Engineer)
```
Model: sonnet | Access: Read/Write | MaxTurns: 30
```
Manages Docker, CI/CD, deployment, cloud resources. Never hardcodes secrets.

**When to use:** For infrastructure changes — Dockerfiles, CI pipelines, deployment scripts, environment configuration.

**Example:**
```
@infra add a staging deployment to the GitHub Actions workflow
@infra optimize the Docker build for faster CI
```

**Output includes:** Infrastructure changes, new env vars, rollback plan.

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through structured **HANDOFF** blocks:

```
HANDOFF:
  from: @tester
  to: @team-lead
  reason: testing complete — 3 failures found
  artifacts:
    - test-results.json
    - coverage-report.html
  context: |
    3 tests fail in auth module. Root cause appears to be
    missing null check in token validation.
  iteration: 2/5
  execution_metrics:
    turns_used: 12
    files_read: 8
    files_modified: 3
    tests_run: 47 (44 pass / 3 fail / 0 skip)
    coverage_delta: "+2%"
    hallucination_flags: CLEAN
    regression_flags: CLEAN
    confidence: HIGH
```

**All routing goes through the orchestrator.** Agents never call each other directly — subagents can't spawn subagents in Claude Code.

## 6. Skills Reference

Skills are slash commands you type in Claude Code. Here's every skill and how to use it.

### Setup Skills

#### /scan-codebase
```
/scan-codebase
/scan-codebase /path/to/project
```
Scans your codebase with 6 parallel agents. Takes 2-5 minutes. Outputs scan results to `.claude/scan-results.md`. Run this first before generating the environment.

#### /generate-environment
```
/generate-environment
```
Takes scan results and generates all Claude Code files (CLAUDE.md, agents, skills, hooks, rules, templates, profiles). Must run `/scan-codebase` first — will error if scan results are missing.

#### /validate-setup
```
/validate-setup
```
Runs 170+ automated checks on your environment. Reports PASS/FAIL/WARN with specific fix instructions. Run after `/generate-environment` to verify everything is correct.

#### /setup-smithery
```
/setup-smithery
```
Installs community Smithery skills and MCP servers matching your tech stack. Optional — enhances the environment with third-party tools.

### Workflow Skills

/task-tracker blockers                       # All open blockers
/task-tracker metrics                        # Aggregate performance
```
Manages task lifecycle from BACKLOG to CLOSED. Tracks every phase, loop iteration, handoff, blocker, and decision.

### Analysis Skills

#### /impact-analysis
```
/impact-analysis "replace the auth middleware"
/impact-analysis "upgrade React from 18 to 19"
```
Runs @explorer + @security in parallel to assess blast radius. Outputs: files affected, transitive dependencies, test coverage %, security flags, risk level, Mermaid dependency diagram.

#### /context-check
```
/context-check                  # Check current context usage
/context-check --compact        # Check and auto-compact if over budget
```
Measures context window usage against the 60% working budget. Reports GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED status. Recommends compaction when needed. Runs automatically between workflow phases.

### Reporting Skills

#### /execution-report
```
/execution-report TASK-001              # Full task report
/execution-report TASK-001 --phase 6    # Single phase report
/execution-report last                  # Most recent task
/execution-report all --verbose         # All tasks with detail
```
Post-execution analytics. Generates:
- **Success Score (0-100):** completeness + quality + efficiency
- **Hallucination Check (0-3):** verifies file references, function names, conventions
- **Regression Impact (0-3):** test results, coverage delta, lint/type/build status
- **Agent Communication:** handoff count, loop iterations, parallel executions
- **Token/Context Usage:** estimated consumption, peak context %

#### /progress-report
```
/progress-report dev TASK-001           # Developer: files, tests, coverage
/progress-report qa TASK-001            # QA: changes, test scenarios, risks
/progress-report business               # Business: acceptance criteria, ETA
/progress-report management             # Management: portfolio table, health
/progress-report executive              # Executive: status light, key metrics
```
Generates audience-specific reports. Each audience gets different information at different detail levels.

#### /metrics
```
/metrics velocity                       # Tasks/week, throughput, WIP
/metrics quality                        # Test pass rate, coverage, bug escape rate
/metrics cycle-time                     # Per-phase average, bottlenecks
/metrics agents                         # Per-agent performance, rework rate
/metrics blockers                       # Resolution time, categories
/metrics all --period 30d               # Everything, last 30 days
```
Calculates aggregate performance metrics from task records.

### Maintenance Skills

#### /sync
```
/sync --check                           # Detect drift (report only)
/sync --fix                             # Detect and auto-repair
/sync --fix --component agents          # Fix only agent files
/sync --fix --component claude-md       # Fix only CLAUDE.md
/sync --full-rescan                     # Complete re-scan + regenerate
```
Detects drift between your Claude Code environment and the actual codebase across 8 categories: agents, skills, hooks, rules, CLAUDE.md, settings, tech stack, project structure. See [Section 13](#13-drift-detection--sync) for details.

#### /rollback
```
/rollback deploy TASK-001               # Rollback failed deployment
/rollback code TASK-001                 # Revert all code changes
/rollback phase TASK-001 --to-phase 5   # Undo back to Phase 5
/rollback code --to-commit abc123       # Revert to specific commit
```
Safely undoes deployments, code changes, or workflow phases. Always creates revert commits (never rewrites history). Always runs tests after rollback.

## 7. The Workflow Engine

The `/workflow` skill orchestrates a 13-phase software development lifecycle. Each phase has specific entry/exit criteria, assigned agents, and quality gates.

### Phase Overview

```
Phase 1:  Task Intake       — classify, create branch, drift check
Phase 2:  Impact Analysis    — @explorer + @security blast radius scan
Phase 3:  Architecture       — @architect designs solution (skip if small+LOW)
Phase 4:  Business Analysis  — @product-owner writes acceptance criteria
Phase 5:  Development        — @api-builder / @frontend / @infra build code
Phase 6:  Dev Self-Testing   — @tester runs tests, @debugger fixes failures
Phase 7:  Code Review        — @reviewer + @security review in parallel
Phase 8:  PR + CI            — Create PR, fix CI failures
Phase 9:  QA Testing         — @qa-lead plans, @tester executes, bug loop
Phase 10: Sign-offs          — QA -> Business -> Tech sequential gates
Phase 11: Deployment         — @infra deploys with health checks
Phase 12: Post-Deploy        — Monitor, close issues, notify
Phase 13: Execution Report   — Scored analytics for the entire workflow
```

### Workflow Variants

**Normal Feature:**
All 13 phases in order.

**Hotfix (`--hotfix`):**
Skips Phase 3 (Architecture) and Phase 4 (Business). Uses tighter circuit breakers (max 3 dev-test iterations instead of 5, max 1 deploy attempt). @debugger is the primary dev agent instead of @api-builder.

**Spike (`--spike`):**
Research only. Runs Phase 1-3 (Intake, Impact, Architecture investigation). Produces a research report with findings and recommendation. No code, no tests, no deployment.

### Phase Details

#### Phase 1: Task Intake
- Automatic drift check via `/sync --check`
- Classifies: type (feature/bugfix/refactor/hotfix/spike)
- Classifies: scope (frontend/backend/fullstack/infra)
- Classifies: complexity (small/medium/large)
- Creates branch and task record in `.claude/tasks/TASK-{id}.md`
- Checks `depends-on` — blocks if dependency task not ready

#### Phase 3: Architecture Review — Skip Condition
Automatically skipped when ALL of:
- complexity == small
- risk == LOW (from Phase 2)
- type != refactor

When skipped, logged in task record. When NOT skipped, @architect produces design with alternatives, Mermaid diagrams, and decision record. User must approve before continuing.

#### Phase 5: Development — Sub-Steps

| Sub-step | Condition | Agent |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| 5a: DB migrations | Backend scope + database changes | @api-builder |
| 5b: Backend code | Backend scope | @api-builder |
| 5c: Frontend code | Frontend scope | @frontend |
| 5d: Tests | Always | @tester |

**Fullstack execution:** 5a runs first (DB must be ready). Then 5b + 5c run in parallel using `isolation: worktree` (separate git copies). Backend merges first, frontend adapts. Both must complete before Phase 6.

#### Phase 10: Sign-offs — Preservation Rules

When a sign-off gate rejects, some earlier approvals are preserved:

| Rejection | QA Approval | Biz Approval |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| QA rejects (bugs) | INVALIDATED | INVALIDATED |
| Business rejects (reqs) | PRESERVED | INVALIDATED |
| Business rejects (UI) | PRESERVED | INVALIDATED |
| Tech rejects (architecture) | INVALIDATED | INVALIDATED |
| Tech rejects (perf/tests) | PRESERVED | PRESERVED |

---

## 8. Loop Flows & Circuit Breakers

Every loop in the workflow has a maximum iteration count. When hit, execution STOPS and escalates to the user.

### Loop Summary

| Loop | Phase | Normal Max | Hotfix Max | Scope |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Dev-Test | 6 | 5 iterations | 3 | Global |
| Review-Rework | 7 | 3 iterations | 2 | Global |
| CI Fix | 8 | 3 iterations | 2 | Global |
| QA Bug | 9 | 3 per bug, 15 total | 2/bug, 6 total | Per-bug |
| Sign-off Rejection | 10 | 2 full cycles | 1 cycle | Global |
| Deploy | 11 | 2 attempts | 1 attempt | Global |

### How Loops Work

**Dev-Test Loop (Phase 6):**
```
@tester runs full test suite
  -> ALL PASS -> advance to Phase 7
  -> FAILURES -> route to fix agent by issue type:
       test logic -> @debugger
       backend code -> @api-builder
       frontend code -> @frontend
       config issue -> @infra
     -> fix agent applies fix
     -> @tester re-runs (iteration +1)
     -> iteration 5 -> STOP, escalate to user
```

**Review-Rework Loop (Phase 7):**
```
@reviewer + @security review in parallel
  -> BOTH APPROVE -> advance to Phase 8
  -> SPLIT DECISION -> stricter verdict wins
  -> REQUEST_CHANGES -> route to dev agent by comment type
     -> fix agent addresses comments
     -> ONLY rejecting reviewer(s) re-review
     -> iteration 3 -> STOP, escalate to user
```

**QA Bug Loop (Phase 9):**
```
For each bug (P0 first, then P1, then P2):
  @debugger fixes -> @tester runs regression -> @qa-lead re-verifies
    -> VERIFIED -> close bug
    -> REOPENED -> back to @debugger (iteration +1)
    -> per-bug iteration 3 -> escalate that bug
    -> total attempts > 15 -> escalate entire Phase 9
```

### Circuit Breaker Options

When any loop hits its max, the user is presented with:
1. **Continue** — increase max by N iterations
2. **Re-plan** — go back to Phase 3 (Architecture Review)
3. **Reduce scope** — remove the problematic feature
4. **Cancel** — abandon the task
5. **Assign to human** — flag for manual intervention

### Loop Counter Resets

| Event | What Resets |
|-------|------------|
| Phase 10 rejection -> Phase 5 | dev-test, review, ci-fix reset to 0 |
| Phase 10 rejection -> Phase 3 or 4 | ALL counters reset to 0 |
| Deploy failure -> Phase 5 | dev-test, review, ci-fix reset to 0 |
| ON_HOLD -> resume | NO reset (all preserved) |
| Agent timeout in loop | Counts as +1 iteration |

---

## 9. Hooks & Automation

Hooks are scripts that run automatically in response to events. All hooks are cross-platform Node.js (no bash/jq dependency).

### Hook Reference

| Event | Hook | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **SessionStart** (startup/resume/compact) | `session-start.js` | Re-injects active task context. Shows active, ON_HOLD, and BLOCKED tasks |
| **SessionStart** (startup only) | `drift-detector.js` | Checks for environment drift: stale manifest, agent count mismatch, changed dependencies, orphan hooks |
| **PreToolUse** (Edit/Write) | `protect-files.js` | Blocks edits to `.env`, `.env.local`, lock files, CI configs |
| **PreToolUse** (Bash) | `validate-bash.js` | Blocks dangerous commands: `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, `dd if=`, `curl \| bash` |
| **PostToolUse** (Edit/Write) | `post-edit-format.js` | Auto-formats edited files (Prettier, Black, gofmt, rustfmt) |
| **PostToolUse** (Edit/Write) | `track-file-changes.js` | Logs file modifications to active task's changes log |
| **PostToolUseFailure** | `tool-failure-tracker.js` | Logs tool failures for debugging and execution reports |
| **PreCompact** | `pre-compact-save.js` | Saves loop state, handoffs, blockers to disk before compaction destroys them |
| **PostCompact** | `post-compact-recovery.js` | Re-injects loop state, last handoff, open bugs, blockers after compaction |
| **Notification** (permission_prompt) | `notify-approval.js` | OS notification when Claude needs your approval (macOS/Windows/Linux) |
| **SubagentStop** | `track-file-changes.js` | Records file changes from subagent executions |
| **Stop** | `execution-report.js` + prompt | Captures execution snapshot and forces mandatory completion report |
| **StopFailure** | `stop-failure-handler.js` | Preserves task state on rate limits, auth failures, server errors. Provides recovery instructions |

### How Hooks Interact with Workflow

```
Session starts
  -> session-start.js: "ACTIVE TASK: TASK-001 | STATUS: DEV_TESTING"
  -> drift-detector.js: "DRIFT: package.json changed since last sync"

You edit a file
  -> protect-files.js: blocks if .env or lock file
  -> (edit happens)
  -> post-edit-format.js: auto-formats
  -> track-file-changes.js: logs to TASK-001_changes.log

Context hits 95%
  -> pre-compact-save.js: saves loop state to disk
  -> (compaction runs)
  -> post-compact-recovery.js: "LOOP STATE: dev-test-loop: 3/5"

Session ends
  -> execution-report.js: captures metrics snapshot
  -> Stop prompt: forces success score calculation

Session crashes
  -> stop-failure-handler.js: preserves state, logs error
  -> "Recovery: Wait 60 seconds, then resume: claude --continue"
```

## 10. Task Tracking System

Every task is tracked as a markdown file in `.claude/tasks/TASK-{id}.md`.

### Task Record Structure

```yaml
---
id: TASK-001
title: Add user notification system
type: feature
scope: fullstack
complexity: medium
priority: P2-medium
status: DEV_TESTING
branch: feat/TASK-001-notifications
pr: 42
assigned-to: @api-builder
depends-on: none
created: 2026-03-26T10:00:00Z
updated: 2026-03-26T14:30:00Z
---
```

### Task States

```
BACKLOG -> INTAKE -> ANALYZING -> DESIGNING -> APPROVED
  -> DEVELOPING -> DEV_TESTING -> REVIEWING -> CI_PENDING
  -> QA_TESTING -> QA_SIGNOFF -> BIZ_SIGNOFF -> TECH_SIGNOFF
  -> DEPLOYING -> MONITORING -> CLOSED

Special states (from any active state):
  BLOCKED    — waiting on dependency or manual resolution
  ON_HOLD    — deferred by user or product owner
  CANCELLED  — terminated with cleanup
```

### What Gets Tracked

- **Loop State:** every iteration counter, baseline values, fix agents, last failures
- **Handoff Log:** every agent-to-agent transition with timestamps
- **Timeline:** every event with phase, description, actor, duration
- **Phase Details:** specific outputs for each of 13 phases
- **Blocker Log:** timestamp, severity, owner, resolution
- **Decision Log:** what was decided, rationale, who decided, reversibility
- **Risk Register:** risks, likelihood, impact, mitigation status
- **Execution Reports:** per-phase scores, token usage, agent stats
- **Bug Records:** per-bug severity, status, fix iterations

---

## 11. Execution Reports & Scoring

After every phase and at workflow completion, an execution report is generated.

### Success Score (0-100)

| Category | Points | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Completeness | 40 | Phase exit criteria met, acceptance criteria verified, no skipped phases, task advanced |
| Quality | 30 | Tests pass, coverage maintained, no lint/type errors, review approved, security clean |
| Efficiency | 30 | Completed within expected turns, no circuit breakers, context under 60%, loops resolved quickly |

**Interpretation:**
- 90-100: EXCELLENT
- 70-89: GOOD
- 50-69: FAIR (rework detected)
- 30-49: POOR
- 0-29: FAILED

### Hallucination Check (0-3)

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 | CLEAN | All file:line references verified, all function names real, patterns match project |
| 1 | MINOR | Cosmetic mismatches (wrong line numbers, outdated paths) |
| 2 | MODERATE | Referenced non-existent functions or wrong imports. **Blocks advancement** |
| 3 | SEVERE | Generated code based on invented APIs. **Blocks advancement** |

### Regression Impact (0-3)

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 | CLEAN | No new test failures, coverage maintained |
| 1 | LOW | Coverage decreased slightly, no new failures |
| 2 | MEDIUM | New test failures introduced. **Blocks advancement** |
| 3 | HIGH | Build broken or critical regressions. **Blocks advancement** |

### Where Reports Are Saved

```
.claude/reports/executions/TASK-001_phase-6_2026-03-26T100000Z.md   # Per-phase
.claude/reports/executions/TASK-001_final.md                         # Cumulative
.claude/reports/executions/TASK-001_snapshot_1711443600000.json      # Auto-snapshot
```

## 12. Context Budget Management

Claude Code has a limited context window. This framework keeps usage under 60% during active work.

### What Loads at Startup (~1.2% of 128K)

| Component | Tokens | Loading |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| CLAUDE.md + rules | ~332 | Always |
| Agent descriptions (12) | ~371 | Always (metadata only) |
| Skill descriptions (13) | ~250 | Always (metadata only) |
| Settings.json | ~572 | Always |
| **Total** | **~1,500** | **1.2%** |

### What Costs Zero

| Component | Why Zero Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| Agent full bodies | Load in subagent context (separate window) |
| Forked skills (11/13) | Run in fork context (isolated) |
| Templates, profiles, docs | Never auto-loaded |
| File reads by agents | Done in subagent context |

### What Accumulates (Danger)

| Component | Risk |
|-----------|------|
| File reads in main context | Stay in conversation history |
| Agent results returned to main | Each handoff adds content |
| Bash outputs | Especially long ones |
| Non-forked skill invocations | 2 skills: rollback, setup-smithery |

### Enforcement

1. **Between phases:** `/context-check` runs automatically
2. **At 60%:** STOP and compact before continuing
3. **At 75%:** Aggressive compact or session split
4. **At 95%:** PreCompact hook saves state, auto-compaction fires, PostCompact restores state
5. **Compact command:** `/compact "focus on TASK-001 Phase 6"`

---

## 13. Drift Detection & Sync

Over time, your codebase changes — new dependencies, new directories, team role changes. The sync system detects when the Claude Code environment goes stale.

### Automatic Detection (Every Session)

On every session start, `drift-detector.js` checks:
- Manifest age (warns if >14 days since last sync)
- Agent count matches CLAUDE.md
- Dependency file hashes changed since last scan
- Orphan or missing hooks

### Manual Sync

```bash
/sync --check                    # Report only
/sync --fix                      # Auto-repair everything
/sync --fix --component agents   # Fix only agents
/sync --full-rescan              # Re-scan + regenerate from scratch
```

### 8 Drift Categories

| Category | What's Checked |
|----------|---------------|
| Agents | Files vs CLAUDE.md vs workflow vs manifest |
| Skills | Files vs manifest vs frontmatter compliance |
| Hooks | Files vs settings.json registration |
| Rules | Path globs vs actual directories |
| CLAUDE.md | Tech versions, commands, agent table, key paths |
| Settings | Hook refs, permission patterns |
| Tech Stack | Dependency files vs last scan hashes |
| Structure | Directories vs last scan |

### Manifest

`.claude/manifest.json` tracks the state of every generated file. Updated after every `/sync --fix` or `/generate-environment`. Contains SHA-256 hashes of every agent, skill, hook, rule, and dependency file.

---

## 14. Error Recovery

### Agent Hits maxTurns
- Counts as +1 loop iteration
- @team-lead re-invokes with narrowed scope or reassigns to different agent
- If repeatedly hitting limit: escalate to user

### Tool Failure
- Logged by `tool-failure-tracker.js` to `.claude/reports/tool-failures.log`
- Agent should self-recover (retry with different approach)
- 3 consecutive failures: partial HANDOFF with `status: blocked`

### Session Crash (Rate Limit, Auth, Server Error)
- `stop-failure-handler.js` preserves task state
- Recovery depends on error type:
  - Rate limit: wait 60s, `claude --continue`
  - Auth failure: re-authenticate
  - Server error: retry with `claude --continue`
  - Max tokens: resume to continue generation
- Loop state survives (persisted in task file on disk)

### Deploy Failure
- Triaged before routing (not blind re-route to Phase 5):
  - Config issue: @infra fixes, retry directly
  - Code bug: hotfix fast-track
  - Infra issue: @infra resolves, retry
  - Unknown: `/rollback`, escalate to user

### ON_HOLD Tasks
- Resume: `/workflow resume TASK-id`
- 7+ days: session-start warns
- 30+ days: session-start suggests cancel
- All loop counters preserved on resume

### Cancelled Tasks
- Cleanup: close PR, delete branch, remove worktrees
- Task record preserved for history

---

## 15. Configuration Reference

### settings.json

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "default",
    "allow": ["Bash(git status)", "Bash(git diff *)"],
    "deny": ["Bash(rm -rf /)", "Bash(sudo *)"]
  },
  "env": {},
  "hooks": { ... }
}
```

- **permissions.defaultMode:** `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `auto`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`
- **permissions.allow:** Bash command patterns to auto-approve
- **permissions.deny:** Bash command patterns to always block
- **env:** Environment variables
- **hooks:** Event-to-script mappings (see [Section 9](#9-hooks--automation))

### settings.local.json (gitignored)

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://localhost:5432/myapp",
    "API_KEY": "sk-..."
  }
}
```

Machine-specific settings. Never committed to git.

### CLAUDE.md

Project-level instructions that Claude reads on every session. Max 200 lines (150 recommended). Contains tech stack, commands, architecture, code style, git conventions, key paths.

### Rules (.claude/rules/*.md)

Path-scoped instructions. Each rule has a `paths:` frontmatter that controls when it loads:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/api/**/*.ts"
---
# API rules load only when working in src/api/
```

## 17. Customization Guide

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `.claude/agents/my-agent.md` with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: What this agent does. Use when [trigger condition].
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: sonnet
maxTurns: 30
effort: high
memory: project
---
```

2. Add structured output format, HANDOFF block with execution_metrics, and Limitations section
3. Run `/sync --fix` to update CLAUDE.md agent table and workflow references

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create directory `.claude/skills/my-skill/`
2. Create `.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:
```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does.
user-invocable: true
context: fork
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
argument-hint: "[argument description]"
---
# My Skill: $ARGUMENTS
Instructions here...
```

3. Run `/sync --fix` to register in commands reference

### Modifying the Workflow

Edit `.claude/skills/workflow/SKILL.md`. If you add a new phase:
1. Add the phase definition with entry/exit criteria
2. Map it to a task state in the Task State Machine section
3. Update the circuit breaker table if the phase has loops
4. Update `.claude/docs/flow-engine.md` with the detailed flow

### Adding a New Hook

1. Create `.claude/hooks/my-hook.js` (Node.js, use `process.stdin` for input, `process.exit(0)` to allow, `process.exit(2)` to block)
2. Register in `.claude/settings.json` under the appropriate event
3. Run `/sync --fix` to verify registration

### Modifying Rules

Edit or create `.claude/rules/my-rule.md`. Use `paths:` frontmatter to scope when the rule loads:
```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/payments/**"
  - "src/billing/**"
---
# Payment Rules
- All amounts in cents (integer), never floating point
- ...
```

---

## 18. Troubleshooting

### "CLAUDE.md already exists"
```bash
npx claude-code-scanner init --force
```

### Verification fails
```bash
npx claude-code-scanner verify
# Read the FAIL messages and fix each one
```

### "scan-results.md not found"
Run `/scan-codebase` before `/generate-environment`.

### Context keeps hitting 95%
- Run `/context-check` to see what's consuming space
- Use `/compact "focus on current task"` between phases
- Avoid reading large files in main context — let agents read them
- Consider starting a new session for remaining phases

### Agent hits maxTurns repeatedly
- The task may be too complex for one agent invocation
- Break into smaller sub-tasks via @team-lead
- Or increase maxTurns in the agent's .md file

### Drift warnings on every session
```bash
/sync --fix    # Auto-repair stale files
```
Or if too many warnings:
```bash
/sync --full-rescan    # Complete re-scan + regenerate
```

### ON_HOLD task won't resume
```bash
/workflow resume TASK-001
```
If task state is corrupted, read the task file in `.claude/tasks/TASK-001.md` and manually set the status.

### Tests fail after sync
`/sync --fix` updated environment files but didn't change application code. If tests fail, the issue is likely in the code itself, not the environment. Run `@debugger` to investigate.

### Hook blocks a legitimate operation
Check the hook's logic:
- `protect-files.js` blocks .env and lock files
- `validate-bash.js` blocks dangerous commands
If the operation is legitimate, temporarily remove the hook from `settings.json` or modify the hook's filter list.
